# Arduino-light-bulb-for-outdoor
In this project, the lamp is designed to turn on when the distance sensor detects an object closer than 20cm.
The trig pin is connected to 2. Echo pin connected to 3. Led connected to pin 9.
There are two variables named distance and long sure.
Necessary definitions and serial communication are set in the void setup section.
If the distance is less than 20 cm or equal to 20 cm, the LED will light and the LED active message will appear on the screen.
In cases other than this, the LED will not be active on the screen and the LED will turn off.
